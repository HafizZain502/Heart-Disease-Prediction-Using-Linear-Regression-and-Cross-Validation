# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression-and-Cross-Validation
The goal of this project is to apply linear regression to predict heart disease and evaluate the model's performance using various metrics. We also employ cross-validation to ensure that our model's performance is robust and generalizes well to unseen data.
